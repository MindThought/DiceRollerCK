# DiceRollerCK
A simple dice roller that 

1. rolls dice, exploding or not,
2. calculates the average empirically for dice rolled at 1
3. gives the exact spread for non-explosive dice-pools.

# Warning:
This may take several hours to compute for large dice-pools, such as the reason I made this, 14k7 d6;
